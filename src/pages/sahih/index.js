              The Ṣaḥīḥ is only one of many works ascribed to al-Bukhārī. By the
              age of eighteen, he had composed a treatise on the opinions of the
              Companions and the Successors and prepared a draft of his renowned
              al-Tārīkh al-kabīr.1 His purported oeuvre comprises over thirty
              books and tracts on theology, law, history, prosopography,
              polemics, and filial piety. To date, only about ten of his books
              are published. 2 Many books are either misattributed to him, or
              they are different iterations (ibrāza) of the same book or
              sections extracted from his larger works.3 For instance, he is
              said to have composed a large collection on Qurʾānic exegesis, but
              this appears to be the chapter of Tafsīr from his Ṣaḥīḥ.4 During
              his lifetime, al-Tārīkh al-kabīr caught the attention and
              engagement of the scholarly community,5 but it was the Ṣaḥīḥ that
              would eventually not only overshadow his own scholarly output but
              dominate the hadith tradition as a whole.

            At some point during his extensive academicflex flex-wrap
            justify-between items-start travels, al-Bukhārī was in Nishapur
            sitting in the company of the great hadith scholar Isḥāq b. Rāhawayh
            (d. 238 AH) when someone in the audience suggested that one gather
            the circulating authentic hadith in a single collection, something
            unheard of at the time.6 As the seed was planted in al-Bukhārī’s
            mind, it began to germinate, and spurred him on a sixteen-year
            project of compiling his magnum opus.7 Al- Bukhārī initially
            compiled a massive collection entitled al-Mabsūṭ,8 wherein he
            gathered all his hadith and organized them into chapters. According
            to Ibn Ṭāhir al-Maqdisī (d. 507 AH), he then drew on this reservoir
            of narrations to compile the Ṣaḥīḥ, by handpicking those that met
            his standards of authenticity.9 The body of hadith that al-Bukhārī
            used for his Ṣaḥīḥ were a mixture of “live” oral traditions and
            previously compiled books.10 Some of the written corpora that he
            cites in his Ṣaḥīḥ include Maʿmar’s (d. 153 AH) Jāmiʿ, Mālik’s (d.
            179 AH) Muwaṭṭāʾ, Ibn Abī Shayba’s (d. 235 AH) Muṣannaf, and
            al-Farrāʾ’s (207 AH) Maʿānī al-Qurʾān, among other books.11 Since
            the dominant culture at the time required that one cite a chain of
            transmission regardless of the form of one’s source, al-Bukhārī
            would narrate from written sources using phrases that are associated
            with live transmission (e.g., ḥaddathanī).12

          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg mb-6 text_light_brown">
            Al-Bukhārī’s greatest accomplishment through the Ṣaḥīḥ was that he
            filtered the overwhelming body of hadith that was circulating by the
            early third century AH and gathered the most reliable ones in a
            single work. To be sure, he was not blindly collecting hadith based
            solely on reliability. Rather, the Ṣaḥīḥ is an expression of
            al-Bukhārī’s vision of Islamic law, theology, and ethics through
            rigorously authenticated reports from the Prophet (ṣ) and the early
            generations of Muslims. By his own admission, he left out many
            authentic hadith for the fear of unnecessarily prolonging the work.
            13 To compensate for the stringency of his standards for including
            hadith, al-Bukhārī introduced the concept of tarājim, that is,
            chapter headings that precede each section, comprising introductory
            material related to the chapter, such as verses, exegetical
            comments, and scholarly dicta. 14 In addition to its exceptional
            interest in philological material, the Ṣaḥīḥ is thus a multifaceted
            work that ably treads the line between law and hadith and owes its
            complex structure to “the tension between the goals” of these two
            disciplines. 15 The division of themes in the Ṣaḥīḥ demonstrates the
            predominantly legal nature of the Ṣaḥīḥ, 16 but it also highlights
            the importance of topics that receive less importance in hadith
            literature, like Qurʾānic exegesis. 55% of the hadith in the Ṣaḥīḥ
            relate to law (aḥkām); 11% to comportment (ādāb); 11% to history and
            maghāzī; 7% to hagiography (manāqib); 7% to Qurʾānic exegesis; 4% to
            heart-softeners (riqāq); 4% to theology; and 1% to eschatology
            (fitan). 17

              The Ṣaḥīḥ consists of four types of narrations:

              <li className="text-base lg:text-lg  text_light_brown">

                2) corroborating reports (mutābaʿāt);

              <li className="text-base lg:text-lg  text_light_brown">

            <p className="text-base lg:text-lg lg:mb-6 text_light_brown">
              The latter two types are found in the chapter headings. His
              standards of authenticity were applied only to the primary hadith,
              i.e., prophetic hadith with continuous chains. 18 The other
              categories were subject to a lower standard of verification. 19
              According to Ibn Ḥajar, the Ṣaḥīḥ comprises the following number
              of narrations. Including repetitions, there are 7397 primary
              hadith; 1341 suspended reports;

            <p className="text-base lg:text-lg  text_light_brown">
              and 344 corroborating reports and allusions to alternative routes.
              20 Thus, the total number of prophetic hadith including
              repetitions is 9079. Then, there are 1608 non-prophetic reports.
              Putting all the categories together, there are 10690 narrations in
              the Ṣaḥīḥ. 21 For the sake of convenience, this study uses the
              prevalent number 7563 to account for the primary and corroborating
              hadith in the main text, as enumerated by the Egyptian editor
              Muḥammad Fuʾād ʿAbd al-Bāqī (d. 1968), though it is not free of
              criticism. 22 Ultimately, The exact number of narrations and
              chapters (discussed later) in the Ṣaḥīḥ depends on the method of
              counting one uses and the recension one consults.

            According to the prevalent numbering system, the printed editions of
            Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī based on al-Farabrī’s recension contain 97 Kitāb
            titles. However, 19 of these titles do not appear in any reliable
            manuscript or recension, and two titles are only found in the
            mustakhraj works. From the remaining, the inclusion of 29 titles is
            agreed upon within the Farabrī tradition, and 55 titles are
            disputed. 23 Although most printed editions of the Ṣaḥīḥ today
            contain 97 Kitāb titles, there is considerable disagreement among
            the secondary literature and earliest prints, chiefly due to
            conflicting views on labelling certain bābs as Kitābs. In recent
            secondary literature, for instance, Muḥammad al- Tūqādī’s 1896 index
            enumerates 68 Kitāb titles and Riḍwān Muḥammad’s 1949 index
            enumerates 91 titles. 24 In the eighth century AH, al-Kirmānī
            estimated that there are about 100 Kitāb titles, an estimation that
            was reiterated by the Ottoman encyclopedist Ḥajjī Khalīfa (d. 1067
            AH) in Kashf al- ẓunūn. 25

              The first three volumes were produced between 1862–1868 with
              editorial work by Ludolf Krehl (d. 1901), and the fourth volume
              was completed in 1908 by Theodor Willem Juynboll (d. 1948). This
              edition contains 97 Kitāb titles. This numbering is the source for
              Arent Jan Wensinck’s (d. 1939) Concordance and A Handbook. 27
              Wensinck’s numbering and divisions influenced the work of Muḥammad
              Fuʾād ʿAbd al-Bāqī, whose hadith and chapter numbering system
              prevails in hadith scholarship today. 28 The third is the
              Sulṭāniyya edition, which was published in nine volumes in 1895
              from the Cairene publishing house al- Maṭbaʿa al-Amīriyya and
              reviewed by a committee of scholars from al-Azhar. 29 Based on its
              table of contents, the Sulṭāniyya edition contains 45 titles
              explicitly labelled “Kitāb.” Some sections were divided in the
              same format as a Kitāb though not labelled as such, like Bāb Wujūb
              al-Zakāh (prefaced with “Kitāb” in the Yūnīniyya) and Faḍāʾil
              al-Qurʾān (presented similarly in the Yūnīniyya). The Yūnīniyya,
              which indirectly formed the basis of the Sulṭāniyya, 30 contains
              about 68 Kitāb titles.

              That a hadith in the Ṣaḥīḥ was transmitted from a written source
              was not always expressly stated. At times, when al-Bukhārī says,
              “Qutayba narrated to us from Malik from Nāfiʿ” he may well be
              drawing on the Muwaṭṭaʾ, which can be confirmed with a quick
              comparison between the two works. For a list of 644 hadith that
              al-Bukhārī narrates from Mālik and are found in the Muwaṭṭaʾ, see
              Fuat Sezgin, Bukhārī key maʾākhidh: Nāqidānah jāʾizah (Faisalabad:
              Maktabah Islāmiyyah Lahore, 2022), Urdu trans. Khālid Ẓafar Allāh,
              Appendix II. Interestingly, a variant is often preferred on the
              grounds that the wording corresponds to the written source that
              al-Bukhārī relied upon. See Ibn Ḥajar, Fatḥ al-Bārī, 4:277.

              18) This explanation is substantiated by the purported title of
              the Ṣaḥīḥ: al-Jāmiʿ al-musnad al-ṣaḥīḥ al-mukhtaṣar min umūr rasūl
              Allāh—ṣallallāhu ʿalayhi wa-sallam—wa-sunanihi wa-ayyāmihi (The
              Comprehensive Sound Musnad Epitome of the Prophet’s Affairs, Deeds

              the musnad narrations (prophetic hadith with continuous chains).
              See Abū Ghudda, Taḥqīq ismay al-Ṣaḥīḥayn wa-ism Jāmiʿ al-Tirmidhī
              (Aleppo: Maktab al- Maṭbūʿāt al-Islāmiyya 1993), 9–12. In the
              earliest reference to the Ṣaḥīḥ, al-Tirmidhī refers to it only as
              “Kitāb al-Jāmiʿ.” By the late third century AH, the celebrated
              bibliophile of Baghdad, Ibn al-Nadīm (d. ca. 380 AH), referred to
              it as “Kitāb al-Ṣaḥīḥ.” The earliest commentator on the Ṣaḥīḥ, Abū
              Sulaymān al-Khaṭṭābī (d. 388 AH), referred to it as “al-Jāmiʿ
              al-ṣaḥīḥ.” See Ibn al-Nadīm, al-Fihrist, 282; al-Khaṭṭābī, Maʿālim
              al-sunan (Aleppo: al-Maṭbaʿa al-ʿIlmiyya, 1932), 2:10, 4:329. For
              an insightful presentation on the titles of Jāmiʿ al-Tirmidhī that
              is relevant for the current discussion, see Aḥmad Maʿbad, “al-Imām

              reach the level of ḥasan (fair). See Ibn Ḥajar, Hudā al-sārī, 19;

              several suspended and post- prophetic reports into his count,
              which partly accounts for his numbering being larger than the
              numbering of others. See ʿAbd al-Sattār al-Shaykh, al-Imām
